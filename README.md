## **Work in Progress** 

#### A game made with Phaser + ES6 + Webpack.

![Phaser+ES6+Webpack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lean/phaser-es6-webpack/master/assets/images/phaser-es6-webpack.jpg)

## 1. Install dependencies (optionally you can install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)):

Navigate to the cloned repo's directory.

Run:

`npm install`

or if you chose yarn, just run `yarn`

## 2. Run the development server:

Run:

`npm run dev`

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser. It will also start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser automatically.

To run the game, open your browser and enter http://localhost:3000 into the address bar.
